Just trying Go (Echo) [Backend] + Next.Js [Frontend] + MySQL [DB] + Docker Compose [Containerization]  

If you want to try, please make sure docker and docker compose are installed.  
1. git clone this repo
2. run this command  
  Windows:
  ``` docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d ```

Postman : https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17343050/U16qKPRz
